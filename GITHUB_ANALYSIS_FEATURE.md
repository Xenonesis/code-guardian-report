# GitHub Repository Analysis Feature

## Overview
The Code Guardian now supports direct GitHub repository analysis! You can analyze any public GitHub repository without downloading and uploading it as a ZIP file.

## Features

### üöÄ Direct Repository Analysis
- Paste any GitHub repository URL
- Automatic repository validation
- Real-time repository information display
- Progress tracking during download

### üìä Repository Information
When you enter a valid GitHub URL, you'll instantly see:
- Repository name and description
- Primary programming language
- Number of code files to be analyzed
- Estimated repository size

### üîç Supported URL Formats
The analyzer supports multiple GitHub URL formats:
- `https://github.com/owner/repository`
- `https://github.com/owner/repository/tree/branch-name`
- `https://github.com/owner/repository.git`

### üéØ Smart File Filtering
The system automatically:
- Filters out non-code files
- Excludes common build directories (node_modules, dist, build, etc.)
- Focuses on source code files only
- Supports 30+ programming languages

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Enter GitHub URL**: Paste your repository URL
2. **Validation**: System checks if repository exists and is accessible
3. **Repository Info**: Shows repository details and estimated size
4. **Download**: Fetches repository contents via GitHub API
5. **Package**: Creates a ZIP file with code files only
6. **Analysis**: Runs the same comprehensive security analysis

### Technical Details

#### File Types Analyzed
- JavaScript/TypeScript (.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx)
- Python (.py)
- Java (.java)
- C/C++ (.c, .cpp, .h)
- C# (.cs)
- Go (.go)
- Rust (.rs)
- Ruby (.rb)
- PHP (.php)
- Swift (.swift)
- Kotlin (.kt)
- Scala (.scala)
- Vue (.vue)
- HTML/CSS (.html, .css, .scss, .sass)
- Configuration files (.json, .xml, .yaml, .yml)
- Shell scripts (.sh, .bash, .ps1)
- And more...

#### Excluded Directories
- `node_modules/`
- `.git/`
- `dist/`, `build/`
- `coverage/`
- `vendor/`
- `target/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `.venv/`, `venv/`
- And other common build/dependency folders

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Analyze a React Project
```
https://github.com/facebook/react
```

### Example 2: Analyze a Specific Branch
```
https://github.com/username/project/tree/development
```

### Example 3: Your Own Repository
```
https://github.com/yourusername/your-project
```

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **No Manual Download**: Skip the download and upload steps
- **Always Fresh**: Analyze the latest code from the repository
- **Branch Support**: Analyze any branch, not just main
- **Efficient**: Only downloads and analyzes code files
- **Fast**: Optimized with batch processing and rate limiting

### üîí Privacy & Security
- Uses official GitHub API
- No authentication required for public repositories
- Code is processed locally in your browser
- Same security analysis as uploaded files
- No code stored on external servers

## Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Public Repositories Only**: Private repositories require authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: GitHub API has rate limits (60 requests/hour for unauthenticated)
- **Repository Size**: Very large repositories may take longer to download
- **Network Required**: Requires internet connection to fetch repository

### Future Enhancements
- Support for private repositories (with OAuth)
- Repository caching for faster re-analysis
- Multiple repository comparison
- GitHub Actions integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Repository not found or not accessible"
- Verify the URL is correct
- Ensure the repository is public
- Check if you have network connection

#### "No code files found in repository"
- Repository may contain only documentation
- Try a different branch
- Verify the repository contains actual code

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
- GitHub API limits: 60 requests/hour
- Wait an hour or authenticate with GitHub token
- Try again later

## API Reference

### GitHub Repository Service
The feature is powered by `githubRepositoryService` with the following capabilities:

```typescript
// Parse GitHub URL
parseGitHubUrl(url: string): GitHubRepoInfo | null

// Validate repository
validateRepository(owner: string, repo: string): Promise<boolean>

// Get repository information
getRepositoryInfo(owner: string, repo: string): Promise<RepositoryInfo>

// Download as ZIP file
downloadRepositoryAsZip(
  owner: string, 
  repo: string, 
  branch: string,
  onProgress?: (progress: number, message: string) => void
): Promise<File>

// Estimate size
estimateRepositorySize(
  owner: string, 
  repo: string, 
  branch: string
): Promise<SizeEstimate>
```

## Integration

The GitHub analysis feature is seamlessly integrated into the existing upload flow:

1. **Upload Form**: Enhanced with tabs for "Upload ZIP" and "GitHub Repository"
2. **Same Analysis Engine**: Uses identical security analysis engine
3. **Same Results Display**: Results are displayed in the same format
4. **Same Storage**: Analysis results are stored and cached the same way

## Best Practices

### For Best Results
1. **Use Specific Branches**: Analyze the branch you're interested in
2. **Check Repository Size**: Smaller repositories analyze faster
3. **Verify Repository**: Ensure it's a code repository, not just docs
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the progress bar during download

### Performance Tips
- Start with smaller repositories to test
- Use branch-specific URLs when possible
- Avoid analyzing during peak times for better rate limits
