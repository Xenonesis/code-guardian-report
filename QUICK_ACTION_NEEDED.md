## 🔍 POSSIBLE SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: Project Exists with Different ID
**Example**: You see "Code Guardian Report" but Project ID is `code-guardian-abc123`

**Solution**: I'll update `.env.local` and `.firebaserc` with the correct ID

### Scenario B: Project Exists as `code-guardian-report`
**Solution**: You need to add your account as a collaborator
- Ask project owner to add you
- Or verify you're signed in with the right Google account

### Scenario C: Project Doesn't Exist Yet
**Solution**: We have two options:
1. Create new project with ID `code-guardian-report`
2. Use `neofi-5e481` (indexes already there)
