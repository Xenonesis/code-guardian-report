## Bugs Fixed During Testing

### 1. Babel Traverse Import Issue
**Problem:** `traverse is not a function` error  
**Fix:** Updated imports to handle both default and named exports  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/analysis/ASTAnalyzer.ts`
- `src/services/analysis/DataFlowAnalyzer.ts`

### 2. SQL Injection Pattern Enhancement
**Problem:** SQL injection not detected in string concatenation  
**Fix:** Enhanced regex pattern to catch `SELECT ... +` and `WHERE/FROM` patterns  
**File Modified:**
- `src/services/security/modernCodeScanningService.ts`

### 3. Dependency Analysis Missing Fields
**Problem:** Production and Development counts showing as undefined  
**Fix:** Added separate counting for prod/dev dependencies  
**File Modified:**
- `src/services/analysis/MetricsCalculator.ts`

### 4. Risk Level Missing
**Problem:** Risk level showing as undefined in summary  
**Fix:** Added risk level calculation to summary metrics  
**File Modified:**
- `src/services/analysis/MetricsCalculator.ts`
