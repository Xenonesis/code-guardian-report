## Key Components

### User Interface
- **Description**: Modern UI components for navigation, dashboards, and visualizations.
- **Components**: Navigation, UploadForm, FloatingChatBot, ErrorBoundary

### Security Analysis Dashboard
- **Description**: Central hub for displaying security metrics, risk assessments, and quality scores.
- **Components**: MetricsCards, SeverityChart, TrendChart, OWASPChart

### AI Insights Panel
- **Description**: Provides AI-driven security insights and recommendations.
- **Components**: AISecurityInsights, SecurityRecommendations

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Description**: Tracks and analyzes security metrics in real-time.
- **Components**: AnalysisTracker, MetricsCalculator

### Security Metrics
- **Description**: Visualizes key security metrics using various charts.
- **Components**: SeverityChart, TrendChart, FileComplexityChart

### Risk Assessment
- **Description**: Assesses and visualizes security risks.
- **Components**: RiskAssessment, OWASPChart

### Quality Score
- **Description**: Evaluates and displays the quality score of the analysis.
- **Components**: QualityScoreCard, FileComplexityChart

### AI Service
- **Description**: Core AI service for generating security insights.
- **Components**: AIService, AIUtils

### Enhanced Analysis Engine
- **Description**: Sophisticated analysis engine for detailed security evaluations.
- **Components**: EnhancedAnalysisEngine, SecurityUtils

### Analysis Tracker
- **Description**: Tracks and logs analysis activities.
- **Components**: AnalysisTracker
#### Analysis Tracker (Updated v2.5.6+)
- **Persistence:** Uses an in-memory cache for all analysis tracking (no localStorage or browser storage).
- **API:**
  - `trackFileAnalysis(userId: string): void` — Track a file analysis event for a user.
  - `getTotalFilesAnalyzed(): number` — Get the total number of files analyzed.
  - `getUserAnalysis(userId: string): UserAnalysis | null` — Get analysis stats for a user.
  - `getAllUserAnalytics(): UserAnalysis[]` — Get stats for all users.
  - `resetAnalysisCache(): void` — Reset the in-memory cache (for testing).
- **Testing:** All tests use the in-memory cache and `resetAnalysisCache()` for isolation.
- **Note:** All analytics are ephemeral and reset on reload; no persistent storage is used.

### Metrics Calculator
- **Description**: Calculates various security metrics.
- **Components**: MetricsCalculator

### Security Analyzer
- **Description**: Analyzes security data and generates reports.
- **Components**: SecurityAnalyzer
